The Bible calls this sin, and it means that none of us deserve God&rsquo;s love and care; instead we deserve his judgment for our rebellion against him.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">We can&rsquo;t rescue ourselves from this judgment, but God has provided a way to rescue us. That is why Jesus came.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Even before Jesus came, God had promised this rescue. Here is how one prophet, Isaiah, writing hundreds of years before Jesus came, put it:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>&lsquo;We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way;&nbsp;</em><br /><em> and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.&rsquo;</em></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jesus didn&rsquo;t come just as an example to us of how we should live. He came to live the life we should have lived for us, and then to take upon himself the just punishment for the lives we actually have lived - in our place.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">That is why Jesus died on a cross. He didn&rsquo;t deserve to die. He was completely innocent of all wrongdoing. But he didn&rsquo;t die against his wishes either, as if he were unable to do anything about it. He&nbsp;chose&nbsp;to die, as a sacrifice in the place of all people who wish to put their trust in him.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">And three days later, Jesus rose to life again, showing that he had fully paid the price for all our sin and that he is more powerful than death, so we can trust him with our own deaths, and have confidence that he will raise us to new lives with him!</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"color: #ffffff;\">(Look further:&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a style=\"color: #ffffff; text-decoration: underline;\" href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+1%3A1-15&amp;version=NIVUK\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none;\">John 1:1-15</span></a></span>)</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>","backgroundColor":"white"},"hide":false,"showInMenu":false,"menuText":null,"menuIcon":null},{"name":"expandablecontent-component","contentData":{"title":"Jesus will judge","text":"<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One day Jesus will come back, and will judge all people for how they have lived.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">God&rsquo;s standard is perfection.
